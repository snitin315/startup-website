      This world is now becoming more and more entrepreneur-oriented. A start-up begins with an idea and the prime obstruction is how to take forward that idea towards a successful business keeping in view the societal issues. We expect people coming with different interests and backgrounds. Some people may have successful start-ups while some might just have ideas and looking for some kind of mentorship and funding to take the
      idea to implementation. Through our Start-Up event we will lay a platform for the networking and interaction amongst the speakers, young entrepreneurs and the audience (participants).
